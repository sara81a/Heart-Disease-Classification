### The reason for choosing the Heart-Disease-Classification data set are :

* Health Impact: Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and early detection of the disease can greatly improve patient outcomes. Developing an accurate model for heart disease classification could help healthcare professionals diagnose the disease more quickly and accurately, leading to better treatment and prevention strategies.
* Data Availability: The availability of large and diverse datasets related to heart disease makes it an attractive problem for researchers and data scientists. The dataset may contain various factors such as patient age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other relevant health information that can be used to develop predictive models.

The aim of this project is to apply machine learning (ML) techniques.
