Our data set is used to forecast heart disease, and this forecast depends on changes in MaxHR and Oldpeak. Thus, we are unable to remove these rows. We must transform these values because Cholesterol and RestingBP cannot both be 0, even in the case of a dead person who still has hydrostatic blood pressure.
